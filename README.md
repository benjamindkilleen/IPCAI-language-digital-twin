# IPCAI-language-digital-twin
Code and data for our paper, "Intelligent Control of Robotic X-ray Devices using a Language-promptable Digital Twin," to be presented at the international conference on Information Processing in Computer Assisted Interventions (IPCAI) 2025. A preprint is available [on arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08020).

## Cadaver Dataset

The cadaver dataset collected on 2024-10-19 can be downloaded [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1pV8qaW4kHGI8wrDWc6wVWS4za5XRWsXA/view?usp=sharing). It consists of 80 single-shot X-ray images, 46 of which are from unique viewpoints, of a cadaveric specimen. The specimen included the torso section from the mid-femur to the T2 vertebra, not including the arms, from a 60 year-old female donor with a living height of 157\,cm and living weight of 50\,kg. The specimen was thawed at 4\degree C for 6 days prior to the study. All fluoroscopic images were acquired with navigation relative to a fixed patient array. The X-ray images are automatically registered to 4 CT images, included in the dataset, covering the full specimen.
